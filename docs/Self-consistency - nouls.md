> Route uncertain probabilities to human review while keeping the underlying noul values visible.

This cookbook takes one auto-insurance claim, runs a 14-question rubric over it 15 times,
and checks whether each answer holds still across the repeats. Every check is a
`Noul`, so each answer is P(true) for one True/False question. In a claims-triage
pipeline, which sorts incoming claims into pay, deny, or send-to-a-human, probabilities
guide the decision. Small changes near a threshold can change which action is taken.
d
The rubric is 14 `Noul` questions, and each run is one call that answers all 14. We do
`NUM_SAMPLES` = 15 repeats per condition, where a condition is one model plus one setting,
and show every probability that came back.

The conditions:

* Non-reasoning LLMs `claude-haiku-4-5` and `gpt-5.4-mini`, at temperature `0` and the
  API default.
* The same two non-reasoning models in True/False mode: one bare yes or no per question,
  mapped to 1.0 and 0.0.
* Reasoning LLMs `gpt-5.5` and `claude-opus-4-8`, which have no temperature dial.
* TypeSafe: one `system_one` call over the 14 `Noul` questions, with a fresh `uid` field
  (a throwaway unique value) on each call.

What to look for: the LLM answers move from run to run, at temperature `0` too, and on the
judgment calls the models disagree with *themselves*. TypeSafe's mean per-question
probability standard deviation is `0.0102`, below all LLM probability conditions here.
Its `covered` answers span `0.43` to `0.53`, crossing a `0.5` decision threshold.

We also turn probabilities from `0.30` through `0.70` into an explicit `uncertain` outcome
for human review. The final illustration maps TypeSafe probabilities to these actions
while keeping the underlying probabilities visible.

## Setup

```bash theme={null}
pip install anthropic openai matplotlib ipython 'cooksafe>=0.2.0,<0.3.0'
```

then set `TYPESAFE_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, and `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
This run uses `jev-latest` on the production API, sampled on 2026-09-11.

## The state: an auto-insurance claim, as JSON

One claim with a few borderline calls built in:

* The loss happened at a track-day event (the policy excludes "track/competitive driving"),
  but in the parking lot while the car was stationary, not on the circuit.
* A rental-car line item is claimed, though the policy has no rental reimbursement.
* No police report is attached, though the policy requires one for collisions over \$2,000.
* An auto-triage note already marks the claim "approved, pay full amount" before any human
  review, and without withholding the deductible.

Some rubric questions below are clear-cut; several are the borderline kind where sampled
LLM answers scatter and the models disagree.

The claim is a JSON structure. The LLMs get `json.dumps(CLAIM)` in the prompt; TypeSafe
takes the structure as the state directly.

```python expandable theme={null}
CLAIM = {
    "policy": {
        "policy_id": "AP-77413",
        "policyholder": "Dana M.",
        "effective": "2026-01-15",

```

## The rubric: 14 `Noul` questions

One `key -> question` entry per row, phrased so a yes means the thing we are checking for
is true. That keeps every row comparable: each model's probability and TypeSafe's `noul`
measure the same thing.

```python theme={null}
QUESTIONS = {
    "covered": "Is the loss covered under the policy's collision coverage?",
    "exclusion": "Does a policy exclusion apply to this loss?",
    "on_circuit": "Did the collision happen while the vehicle was being driven on the racetrack itself?",
    "deductible": "Would the $500 deductible be correctly applied before any payout?",
    "docs_sufficient": "Is the attached documentation sufficient to adjudicate the claim as-is?",
    "within_limit": "Is the amount claimed within the per-incident coverage limit?",
    "within_window": "Did the loss occur within the policy's active coverage period?",
    "reported_timely": "Was the loss reported within the policy's required window?",
    "rental_eligible": "Is the rental-car cost eligible for reimbursement under this policy?",
    "fraud_flag": "Are there indicators that warrant a fraud review?",
    "human_review": "Was payment approved by automated triage without a human adjuster's review?",
    "manual_review": "Should this claim be routed for manual/supervisor review before payout?",
    "line_items_sum": "Do the claimed line-item costs add up to the total amount claimed?",
    "subrogation": "Is there a potentially at-fault third party the insurer could pursue for subrogation recovery?",
}
```

## How we ask

Each LLM call is one prompt holding `json.dumps(CLAIM)` and all 14 questions. The model
returns a JSON object mapping each question's key to a probability. Calls route to
Anthropic or OpenAI by model name: non-reasoning models take a `temperature` (`0` or the
API default), reasoning models think first and take no temperature.

The non-reasoning models also run a True/False variant: they answer each question with a
bare yes or no, which we map to 1.0 and 0.0. This forces a hard decision and shows what
these models do when they cannot leave any mass in the uncertain middle.

The TypeSafe call is one `system_one` request over the same claim and the same 14 `Noul`
questions. Each answer's `noul` is P(true).

Every query also gets a fresh `uid`, a throwaway unique value that changes each run while
leaving the claim and rubric unchanged. It appears in the LLM prompt and as an extra field
in the TypeSafe state. This setup cannot separate sensitivity to the irrelevant field
from variation that would occur on identical requests.

> **Note:** despite the "ONLY a JSON object" instruction, `claude-haiku-4-5` wraps nearly >
> every reply in a ` ```json ... ``` ` fence that strict `json.loads` rejects > (the
> other models return bare JSON). The helper peels the fence; a reply that still fails > to
> parse becomes a parse failure, counted but not scored.

Each helper returns the answer, an estimated cost, and the round-trip latency.

* A check mark is one condition, run 15 times. A dash is a combination that was not tested.
* The default column sends no temperature argument: non-reasoning models use the API
  default, and reasoning models and TypeSafe run without a temperature setting.
* Yes/no answers map to `1.0` / `0.0`.
* Temperature `0` is the usual advice for repeatability, so we compare it with the API
  default.

We draw `NUM_SAMPLES` = 15 repeats per condition. Each repeat has its own cache key and
counts as a distinct draw, and the cache (`json_cache.json`) ships with the cookbook, so
re-rendering reuses it and spends no API calls. Delete the cache to sample live again.

### Cost + speed (per rubric query)

Costs below use the historical price assumptions in Setup, including the `speed_latest`
rate for TypeSafe. They are not verified `jev-latest` prices or current billing amounts.

One row is one full 14-question rubric call. `time/call` and `cost/call` average the 15
calls, and the `vs ts_noul` columns divide by the TypeSafe figures.

```python theme={null}
typesafe_cost = mean([cost for cost, _latency in stats["typesafe_noul"]])
typesafe_latency = mean([latency for _cost, latency in stats["typesafe_noul"]])
name_w = max(len(name) for name in [*LABELS, "typesafe_noul"]) + 2
# Stack comparison headers so the relative speed and cost columns can stay narrow.
print(
    f"{'':<{name_w + 31}}{'speed vs':>11}{'cost vs':>11}\n"
    f"{'condition':<{name_w}}{'calls':>7}{'time/call':>11}{'cost/call':>13}"

In this run TypeSafe has a mean round-trip latency of 111ms. The LLM conditions range
from 1.1 to 13.9 seconds per call under the concurrency settings above.

## Plot: every sample as a heatmap

How to read it:

* Outer row group: the question.
* Inner row: the condition.
* Column: one full rubric call.
* Cell color: red is a higher P(yes), green is lower. For the risk questions, a red cell
  is one the rubric flagged.

`typesafe_noul` varies most on `covered` (`0.43` to `0.53`) and `exclusion` (`0.53` to
`0.62`). Some LLM rows vary at temperature `0` too. Conditions disagree on judgment calls.

The factual checks hold steady across most conditions. The judgment-heavy ones are where
the LLM rows move: `exclusion`, `rental_eligible`, `fraud_flag`, and `manual_review` shift
across samples or disagree across models. TypeSafe's `covered` row crosses `0.5`; its
other 13 questions stay on one side of that threshold throughout this run.

## Allow an uncertain decision instead of forcing yes or no

With a threshold of `0.5`, probabilities `0.49` and `0.51` cause opposite actions even
though both express substantial uncertainty. The application can instead return:

* `no` below `0.30`;
* `uncertain` from `0.30` through `0.70`, including both boundaries;
* `yes` above `0.70`.

Uncertain cases go to a human. The escalation is application logic over the returned
probability: no new question, no second API call. The band is illustrative; it is neither
a calibrated guarantee nor an optimized threshold. Set production boundaries from labeled
examples and from the cost of incorrect decisions and of review.

The illustration below applies this band to the recorded TypeSafe probabilities.

```python expandable theme={null}
def noul_decision_with_uncertainty(probability: float) -> str:
    """Map valid TypeSafe probabilities through an inclusive uncertainty band."""
    if probability < NOUL_UNCERTAINTY_LOW:
        return "no"
    if probability > NOUL_UNCERTAINTY_HIGH:
        return "yes"
    return "uncertain"


# Keep the probabilities visible beneath each TypeSafe application decision.
policy_decisions = [
    [noul_decision_with_uncertainty(sample[key]) for sample in typesafe_runs]
    for key in QUESTIONS
]
decision_codes = {"no": 0, "uncertain": 1, "yes": 2}
policy_values = [
    [decision_codes[value] for value in row] for row in policy_decisions
]
policy_cmap = ListedColormap(["#a6dba0", "#dddddd", "#92c5de"])
fig_policy, ax_policy = plt.subplots(figsize=(13, 6))
ax_policy.imshow(policy_values, cmap=policy_cmap, vmin=0, vmax=2, aspect="auto")
for row_index, key in enumerate(QUESTIONS):
    for sample_index in range(NUM_SAMPLES):
        decision = policy_decisions[row_index][sample_index]
        probability = typesafe_runs[sample_index][key]
        ax_policy.text(sample_index, row_index, f"{decision}\n{probability:.2f}",
                       ha="center", va="center", fontsize=6)

    "TypeSafe application decisions: gray means uncertain "
    f"({NOUL_UNCERTAINTY_LOW:.2f} to {NOUL_UNCERTAINTY_HIGH:.2f} inclusive)"

A review band absorbs fluctuation around `0.5` without issuing opposite automatic
actions. It has edges of its own, though. A value near either outer boundary can still
move between `uncertain` and yes or no. The model is no more deterministic for it, and
an automatic decision that clears the band is not shown to be correct.
