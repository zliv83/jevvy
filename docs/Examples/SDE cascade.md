> Uses a 2-stage structured-data-extraction cascade (mini → verify → reasoning) to get most of the quality of a big reasoning model at a fraction of the cost.

* Overview
  * big reasoning models extract structured data well, but are slow and expensive
  * small models are cheap, but make mistakes
  * a *cascade* gets most of the quality at a fraction of the cost
  * the models we use, and their price (\$ per 1M tokens, input / output; standard rates
    checked September 15, 2026):
    * rung 0 (mini): [`gpt-5.4-mini`](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/models/gpt-5.4-mini)
      at \$0.75 / \$4.50
    * rung 1 (reasoning): [`gpt-5.5`](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/models/gpt-5.5)
      at \$5.00 / \$30.00 (roughly 7x the mini)
    * verifier: TypeSafe `jev-1.12` at \$0.042 / \$0.00 (output tokens are free;
      [published Jev pricing](https://typesafe.ai/blog/introducing-system-one-models-and-jev))
* Algorithm
  1. **Extract** with a cheap/small model.
  2. **Verify** with **TypeSafe** primitives: a per-field yes/no ("Noul question")
     question
     * (e.g. "is this value absent from the source?", "was it lifted from unrelated
       text?"), each returning P(something is wrong).
  3. **Escalate** to an expensive reasoning model if a verifier signal fires; otherwise
     keep the cheap answer.
* This Cookbook
  * walks one real example end-to-end, then shows the tradeoff across 100 prompts
  * note: the two extraction rungs use text-mode OpenAI
  * we do *not* use structured outputs, tool calls, or json mode, because:
    * a *schema following* mistake is not the mistake we expect an LLM to make (it's
      easy
      to make synthetic data for this)
    * if an LLM does fail to follow the schema, it's almost always very confused, so
      constrained decoding doesn't fix the underlying issue
    * we encourage you to try them though!

## Setup

* install the dependencies (the TypeSafe verifier client is served from TypeSafe's package
  index):

```bash theme={null}
pip install openai datasets jsonschema ipython 'cooksafe>=0.2.0,<0.3.0'
```

* then set `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` in your environment

```python theme={null}
import json
import os
from pathlib import Path

import jsonschema
from cooksafe import JsonCache, make_playground_link
from datasets import load_dataset
from IPython.display import Markdown, display
from openai import OpenAI
from typesafe_sdk import Noul, NoulCriteria, TypeSafeClient

MINI = "gpt-5.4-mini"  # rung 0: cheap + fast
REASONING = "gpt-5.5"  # rung 1: strong, run with reasoning_effort="high"
TS_MODEL = "jev-1.12"  # the TypeSafe verifier model
FIRE_T = 0.7  # escalate if any per-field P(wrong) exceeds this; also the "<== FIRES" display marker

oai = OpenAI()

ts = TypeSafeClient(api_key=os.environ["TYPESAFE_API_KEY"], timeout=30.0)
```

## Step 1: the data

We choose a huggingface dataset called scrapegraphai

```python theme={null}
SCRAPEGRAPHAI_REVISION = "4bb9fba1dff9181c5acdb60a5a26fea62fa54fe9"
row = load_dataset(
    "scrapegraphai/scrapegraphai-100k",
    revision=SCRAPEGRAPHAI_REVISION,
    split="train",
)[516]
schema = json.loads(row["schema"])
prompt = row["prompt"]
content = row["content"]

print(
    f"""

{prompt}

SCHEMA

```

* This row is an **NYU events-calendar page** ("Fall 2024 Census Date"):
  * the schema asks for just two fields: `registration_open_date` and `description`
  * the prompt scrape captured only calendar nav and boilerplate: **there is no
    registration date, or description**
  * note the schema's `description` field even ships an *example* value ("Registration
    opens for the fall semester") in its own field description
* so a well-behaved extractor should *decline* to invent the fields the page doesn't
  contain
* let's see if the small model does the right thing!

## Step 2: extract with the mini model (text mode)

* note: `gpt-5.4-mini` is very stochastic on this input -- even at `temperature=0` it
  invents a different `description` on nearly every run. For a reproducible walkthrough we
  **hard-code** the one canonical fabrication the rest of this notebook explains (and that
  the verifier flags at P(wrong) > 0.8). A real pipeline would just take `extract(MINI,
  prompt, schema, content, temperature=0)` directly.

```python expandable theme={null}
EXTRACT_SYSTEM = (
    "You extract structured data from documents. Return only values supported by the text. "
    "Follow any value format specified by the schema or its field descriptions."
)


# LLM and TypeSafe calls are cached to ``json_cache.json``, which ships with the cookbook, so
# re-rendering reproduces the published results with no API spend; delete the file to re-run live.
json_cache = JsonCache(Path("json_cache.json"))


@json_cache
def extract(
    model: str,
    prompt: str,
    schema: dict,
    content: str,
    *,
    reasoning_effort: str | None = None,
    temperature: float | None = None,
) -> dict:
    user = (
        f"{prompt}\n\nReturn ONLY a JSON object matching this JSON Schema:\n"
        f"{json.dumps(schema, indent=2)}\n\nDocument:\n{content}"
    )
    kwargs = {
        "model": model,
        "messages": [
            {"role": "system", "content": EXTRACT_SYSTEM},
            {"role": "user", "content": user},
        ],
    }
    if reasoning_effort:
        kwargs["reasoning_effort"] = reasoning_effort
    if temperature is not None:
        kwargs["temperature"] = temperature
    text = oai.chat.completions.create(**kwargs).choices[0].message.content
    # The prompt asks for ONLY a JSON object, so parse the reply as-is -- no regex fishing a
    # substring out of a malformed reply. If ``json.loads`` fails, treat it as an empty extraction
    # (the record-level analog of NaN): every field reads as absent, which the verifier flags and the
    # gate escalates -- the safe direction. Schema-following errors are rare here (see the overview).
    try:
        return json.loads(text)
    except (ValueError, json.JSONDecodeError):
        return {}


# Hard-coded canonical fabrication (see note above); a real pipeline would use extract(MINI, prompt, schema, content, temperature=0).
mini_record = {
    "registration_open_date": "",
    "description": "Registration opens for the fall semester",
}
print("mini extraction:\n", json.dumps(mini_record, indent=2))

# The record is a perfect fit for the JSON Schema -- and still wrong. Schema validation is necessary
# but not sufficient: it catches structural errors, never semantic ones. That gap is the whole point.
print("\nschema-valid:", jsonschema.Draft202012Validator(schema).is_valid(mini_record))
```

```
mini extraction:
 {
  "registration_open_date": "",
  "description": "Registration opens for the fall semester"
}

schema-valid: True
```

* The record is **schema-valid** (the line above prints `True`), yet it's wrong:
  * `registration_open_date` is left blank, which matches the page: it states no date
  * but `description` is fabricated: the page never describes a registration date, so
    mini invents a plausible one. It may parrot the schema's own example, "Registration
    opens for the fall semester", or narrate "...was not found in the document"
  * a JSON-Schema check can't see this. A cheap model produces confident,
    schema-satisfying fabrications of this kind, and catching them is the job of a
    semantic verifier

## Step 3: verify with TypeSafe

* the verifier is **TypeSafe**; for each field we build a `Noul` question:
  * a narrow yes/no, framed so that `true` = something is wrong (escalate)
* TypeSafe returns a calibrated `noul` = `P(true)` per question, in one system\_one call
* the question set:
  * one holistic **`__overall__::judge`** head ("should this record be escalated?"). We
    compute and display it to contrast a whole-record judgment with the per-field heads,
    but the gate in Step 4 does **not** use it -- escalation is driven by the per-field
    battery.
  * a per-field battery
    * non-empty fields get the full set of heads
    * empty fields (null / "" / \[]) get only the `absence_wrong` head
  * (the full pipeline also has a `spurious` head for whole containers and an overall
    `difficulty` score; not shown here, to keep this walkthrough to the two gating heads)
* **The TypeSafe Way: Decomposition**
  * Notice how everything is *programmatically decomposed*, this is TypeSafe way.
  * Decomposition maximizes the intelligence of every prompt, and makes the algorithm
    tunable and interpretable.

* TypeSafe concentrates the signal on the fields that are actually wrong.
* Our results are calibrated: high on the field that is wrong, low on the field that is
  correct, medium on a field that looks off without being clearly wrong
* This is what a typesafe verifier buys you over a blunt "is this whole thing good?"
  judge

## Step 4: the escalation gate

* now we gate on **`any_flag`**: escalate if *any* field flag exceeds `FIRE_T` (0.7, set
  above and shared with the `<== FIRES` marker in Step 3)
* this is a `max`-style gate (escalate if *any* field fires), not a mean, so one confident
  red flag is enough instead of being averaged into silence

```python theme={null}
# any_flag is a per-field gate: the holistic __overall__ head is shown above but not part of it
fired = {
    qid: p
    for qid, p in checks.items()
    if not qid.startswith("__overall__") and p > FIRE_T
}
escalate = bool(fired)

print(
    f"any_flag gate (threshold {FIRE_T}): {'ESCALATE' if escalate else 'ACCEPT cheap result'}"
)
for qid, p in sorted(fired.items(), key=lambda c: -c[1]):
    print(f"  fired: {qid}  (P={p:.2f})")
```

```
any_flag gate (threshold 0.7): ESCALATE
  fired: description::hallucinated  (P=0.95)
  fired: description::off_target  (P=0.85)
```

## Step 5: escalate to the reasoning model

Since a signal fired, we pay for the strong model (`gpt-5.5`, `reasoning_effort="high"`)

```python theme={null}
final_record = (
    extract(REASONING, prompt, schema, content, reasoning_effort="high")
    if escalate
    else mini_record
)

print("mini      :", json.dumps(mini_record))
print("reasoning :", json.dumps(final_record))
print("\nfield-level diff (mini -> final):")
for name in mini_record:
    if mini_record[name] != final_record.get(name):
        print(f"  {name}: {mini_record[name]!r}  ->  {final_record.get(name)!r}")
```

```
mini      : {"registration_open_date": "", "description": "Registration opens for the fall semester"}
reasoning : {"description": "", "registration_open_date": ""}

field-level diff (mini -> final):
  description: 'Registration opens for the fall semester'  ->  ''
```

* **The improvement**
  * The reasoning model drops the fabricated `description`, returning `""`
  * It recognized the page never describes a registration date, and declined to invent one
  * The cascade turned a confident, schema-valid fabrication into an honest empty field
  * And it only spent reasoning-model dollars on this one item *because the verifier told
    it to*

## Step 6: what this looks like on 100 prompts

* **These are internal TypeSafe results**, produced with the general method above:
  * the same `extract → verify → escalate` loop, `gpt-5.4-mini → gpt-5.5-reasoning`,
    `any_flag` gate over the per-field heads, run over 100 scrapegraphai prompts
  * each item's cheap-rung extraction is scored by TypeSafe; the gate threshold ("cut") is
    swept 0→1, and every resulting config is plotted in (cost, quality) space
  * the chart is a historical snapshot; its costs have not been recalculated at the
    current Jev rate listed above

<img src="https://mintcdn.com/ts-docs/2NirYCl-v96cw05F/cookbooks/sde_cascade/pareto_100prompts.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=2NirYCl-v96cw05F&q=85&s=ca6731507e07b501a6627616ba0b767a" alt="internal results: cost/quality frontier over 100 prompts" width="1299" height="655" data-path="cookbooks/sde_cascade/pareto_100prompts.png" />

* how to read it:
  * **black diamonds** = the four models run on their own (cost climbs with capability; the
    strongest, `gpt-5.5-reasoning`, sits top-right at ≈0.81 quality for ≈\$0.10/extraction)
  * **blue points** = the cascade at many gate thresholds; the dashed line is the **pareto
    frontier**
  * the cascade frontier sits **up-and-left of every single model**: sweeping the gate buys
    you most of the top model's quality at a fraction of its cost
  * the cheap rung handles the easy items for near-free, and only the flagged items pay for
    the reasoning model

## Appendix A: what makes a good verifier signal

* the cascade is only as good as its verifier; what separates a useful signal from a
  useless one:
  * **Narrow and grounded.**
    * one checkable yes/no about one field against the source (e.g. "is this value absent
      from the source?"), not a vague "is this extraction good?"
    * vague questions give mushy, uncalibrated scores
  * **Bad = TRUE, with explicit criteria.**
    * frame each question so the *escalate* case is the `true` case, and state what
      `true`/`false` mean
  * **Per-field, then aggregate with `max`.**
    * a per-field flag localizes the error and stays sparse and strong
    * `max` ("any flag fires") ensures one confident red flag escalates, instead of being
      averaged into silence
  * **Independent and cheap.**
    * a dedicated verifier (here, TypeSafe) judging the output catches the extractor's own
      blind spots
    * it has to be cheap, or there are no savings left to capture
  * **Separating / calibrated.**
    * a good signal is high on real errors and low on correct ones, so a single threshold
      cleanly splits accept vs escalate
    * that separation is what pushes the pareto curve up-and-left
