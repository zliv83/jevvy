System One models are a class of AI models built to make fast, structured decisions that software can use directly. A System One model evaluates a [[State|state]] and returns typed answers and probabilities.

Jev is TypeSafe's flagship model and the first System One model.

Like an LLM, a System One model understands natural-language input. It returns typed decisions and probabilities rather than generated text.

<Note>
  Jev currently accepts text input only. It evaluates strings, JSON objects, and arrays of text. Images, audio, and video are not supported (yet).

## How it differs from an LLM

System One models are trained for calibrated decisions: their probabilities are optimized against outcomes to reflect uncertainty. Calibration is measured across groups of predictions; it does not guarantee that an individual answer is correct.

System One models do not write replies, produce code, or generate explanations of their reasoning. You define the possible answers through [[Primitives (Questions)|primitives]]:

| Primitive                    | Question                              | Example answer space                          | Example output      |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| [[Choice]] | Which team should handle this ticket? | `billing`, `technical`, or `account`          | `choice: "billing"` |
| [[Score]]   | How frustrated is this customer?      | 0 = calm, 1 = frustrated, 2 = very frustrated | `score: 1.4`        |
| [[Noul]]     | Does this message request a refund?   | True or false                                 | `noul: 0.95`        |

These are illustrative configurations and values. The primitive pages describe the available configuration options and full response fields.

Read the [[AI Primer|AI primer]] to learn how System One models work and how they are trained.

<Note>
  The System One name comes from the concept Daniel Kahneman popularized in his book *Thinking, Fast and Slow*. System 1 thinking is fast and intuitive. System 2 is slower and more deliberate. Here, the emphasis is on fast, focused judgments.

## Fast judgments inside a larger workflow

For a refund request, your application can:

1. Build a state containing the customer's message, the relevant transactions, and the refund policy.
2. Ask independent questions together: whether a refund was requested, whether the evidence indicates a duplicate charge, and whether the policy supports a refund.
3. Combine the answers with deterministic checks in code, then route the case for action or review.

Once you have seen the primitives in action, you can combine them into a larger system. Because System One models return typed, constrained outputs rather than free-form text, your code can inspect and combine its answers into predictable workflows. See [[How to build with TypeSafe]] for the full workflow.

Answers from System One models also include [[Confidence]], so you can decide when to act and when to escalate to a person or a reasoning model.

## Call a System One model

Call a System One model through one of our [client SDKs](https://docs.typesafe.ai/sdk) or `POST /v1/systemone` in the [[API reference|HTTP API]]. The `model` field selects which model handles the request. The examples in these docs use `jev-latest`, which is also the SDK default. See [Models](https://docs.typesafe.ai/models) for the available models, their prices, and their aliases.

Start with [[State]] to prepare the input and [[Primitives (Questions)]] to explore the types of questions you can ask.
