> Architectural patterns for building systems with TypeSafe.

TypeSafe is designed to sit within a larger system, powering decisions with AI. Learning to think in terms of discrete, atomic decisions that compose into complex system behavior is a key skill for getting the most out of TypeSafe.

This section assumes you know the [[Primitives (Questions)|TypeSafe primitives]] and understand [[Confidence|how confidence works]]. If not, read those first.

## The patterns

| Pattern                                                  | What it does                                                                                               | Benefits                 |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| [[Speculative fan-out|Speculative Fan-Out]]                 | Send many questions in a single call, including speculative ones, and let your code decide what's relevant | Cost, Speed              |
| [[Confidence-gated routing|Confidence-Gated Routing]] | Utilize confidence as a second decision axis to build safer systems                                        | Reliability, Safety      |
| [[Composite scoring|Composite Scoring]]         | Combine several dimensions of analysis into a single score                                                 | Cost, Reliability, Speed |
| [[Intent routing|Intent Routing]]               | Classify a user's intent and route to the appropriate handler                                              | Cost, Speed              |

<Tip>
  We're always keen to learn how people are making use of our primitives. If you've found a killer use case you think should be mentioned here, feel free to drop us a note!
